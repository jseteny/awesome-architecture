A collaborative list of awesome Software Architecture resources. Feel free to contribute!

## Where to focus
* [Alan Kay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay) (One of the fathers of the idea of object-oriented programming. Other contibutions: Smalltalk, the modern overlapping windowing graphical user interface (GUI), etc
  **"The key in making great and growable systems is much more to design how its
 modules communicate rather than what their internal properties and
 behaviors should be."** Please see his article [here](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?AlanKayOnMessaging)
