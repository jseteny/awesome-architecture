=============

A collaborative list of awesome Software Architecture resources. Feel free to contribute! 

I want to deal here with the architecture of middle to large software systems.

## Where to focus
* [Alan Kay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay) who is one of the fathers of the idea of object-oriented programming wrote the following:
  **"The key in making great and growable systems is much more to design how its
 modules communicate rather than what their internal properties and
 behaviors should be."** Please see the whole article [here.](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?AlanKayOnMessaging)
  Other contributions of Alan Kay: Smalltalk and the modern overlapping windowing graphical user interface (GUI)
